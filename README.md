# Gladiator-Graveyard
Me and my game jam friends made this game for 6 months.

# What am I doing
- I create AI system and coded.
- I made sprite effect.
- Some gameplay feature(change color when take hit, parry system, Card system).

# AI System
- Action Based Decision Tree System. We decide an action, whether the player is nearby or for special events.

They will switch the project from 2d to 3d and I decided to exit the project. 
I asked my friends if it was okay for me to post the source code.
