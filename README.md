# Gladiator-Graveyard
I spent the last 6 months working on a game with my friends.

# What am I doing
- I was in charge of creating the AI system and coding it, as well as creating sprite effects and some gameplay features (such as the change in color when taking a hit, the parry system, and the card system).

# AI System
- The AI system uses an action-based decision tree, which allows the AI to make decisions based on whether the player is nearby or for special events.

My friends have decided to switch the project from 2D to 3D, so I have decided to exit the project. I asked my friends if it was okay for me to post the source code online.
